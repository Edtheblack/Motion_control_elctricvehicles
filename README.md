# MATLAB Simulation: Scalar Speed Control of Induction Motor (U/F Control)

## Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB simulation of scalar speed control for an induction motor using U/F (Voltage to Frequency) control technique. The simulation is developed to analyze and understand the behavior of an induction motor under varying operating conditions and control strategies.

## Features
- Scalar speed control implementation using U/F control technique.
- Simulates the behavior of an induction motor under different load conditions.
- Adjustable parameters for motor characteristics, load torque, and control parameters.
- Visualization of motor speed response and control signals.

## Getting Started
To run the simulation:
1. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. Open the MATLAB script `main.m`.
4. Adjust the simulation parameters as needed.
5. Run the script to execute the simulation.

## Simulation Parameters
- Motor parameters (rated voltage, rated frequency, stator resistance, etc.).
- Load torque characteristics.
- Control parameters (reference speed, U/F ratio, etc.).

## Results
The simulation provides insights into the speed control performance of the induction motor under different operating conditions and control strategies. The results include motor speed response curves, frequency spectrum analysis, and control signal plots.
